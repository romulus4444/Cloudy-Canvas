# Cloudy-Canvas
Created April 5th, 2021

A Discord bot for interfacing with the [Manebooru](https://manebooru.art/) imageboard.

Written by Raymond Welch ([@Dr. Romulus#4444](https://github.com/romulus4444)) in C# using Discord.net. Special thanks to Ember Heartshine for hosting and HenBasket for testing.

I am currently only considering requests to add Cloudy Canvas to servers that I am in, but feel free to contact me on Discord about it.

Cloudy Canvas's profile picture was drawn by me and can be found [here](https://manebooru.art/images/4010266).

Important terms:

`query` Any query that could be entered into the search field on Manebooru. This is a list of comma-seprated terms, and may include logical operators and image metadata flags. See [here](https://manebooru.art/pages/search_syntax) for more details.

`active filter` The Manebooru filter that your server uses to filter images in the search results. It is advisable to make your own account on Manebooru, add a new filter, tailor it to your server's needs, and make it public (at the bottom of the page under Advanced Options). You do not need to leave it as your account's active filter, as long as you know the ID (it's in the URL when viewing the filter: `https://manebooru.art/filters/<filter ID>`) and the filter is public.

`yellowlist` A list of terms that the bot will not search for if included in the query. These terms are not prevented from appearing in search results. Use cases include terms like `breasts` that are inappropriate to search for in a SFW server, but is a perfectly okay tag to appear in search results. This list can include image IDs as well. A user searching for a yellow term will generate an alert message sent to the current yellow alert channel.

`redlist` A list of terms built from tags hidden by the active filter, tags that imply those hidden tags, and tags that are aliased to those hidden tags. It is highly advisable to include `banned tags` in your active filter's hidden tags. Red terms will never appear in any Cloudy search result (because they are blocked by the filter). A user searching for a red term will have their search query deleted by Cloudy, and an alert will be sent to the current red alert channel.

## Commands:
### Booru Module:
*All searches are subject to the current active filter*

---

`;pick <query>` Posts a random image from a Manebooru `<query>`, if it is available. If results include any spoilered tags, the post is made in || spoiler bars.

---

`;pickrecent <query>` Posts the most recently posted image from a Manebooru `<query>`, if it is available. If results include any spoilered tags, the post is made in || spoiler bars.

---

`;id <number>` Posts Image #`<number>` from Manebooru, if it is available. If the image includes spoilered tags, the post is made in || spoiler bars.

---

`;tags <number>` Posts the list of tags on Image #`<number>` from Manebooru, if it is available, including identifying any tags that are spoilered.

---

`;featured` Posts the current Featured Image from Manebooru.

---

`;getspoilers` Posts a list of currently spoilered tags.

---

`;report <id> <reason>` Alerts the admins about image #`<id>` with an optional `<reason>` for the admins to see. Only use this for images that violate the server rules!

---

### Mixins:

Use mixins in the `<query>` to introduce values that are calculated when the query is executed.
Example: If today was May 23rd, 2021, then `;pick created_at:{{today}}, lyra` would execute as `;pick created_at:2021-05-23, lyra`. All date values are generatd using UTC ("Zulu") time. [More info](https://manebooru.art/pages/search_syntax#date-range).

| Template | Info |
| -------- | ---- |
| {{today}} | The current day, month, and year using the ISO 8601 standard. |
| {{current_year}} | The current year. |
| {{current_month}} | The current month. |
| {{current_day}} | The current day. |
| {{current_hour}} | The current hour. |
| {{current_minute}} | The current minute. |
| {{current_second}} | The current second. |

### Admin Module
*Only users with the specified admin role may use the commands in this module*

---

Initial bot setup. Run this before doing anything else when adding Cloudy Canvas to your server!

`;setup <filter ID> <admin channel> <admin role>` *(Only a server administrator may use this command)*

Sets `<filter ID>` as the public Manebooru filter to use, `<admin channel>` for important admin output messages, and `<admin role>` as users who are allowed to use admin module commands. Validates that `<Filter ID>` is useable and if not, uses Filter 175 (Cloudy Canvas's default filter). Filters are viewable at `https://manebooru.art/filters/<filter ID>`. All alert channels are defaulted to the admin channel, and all alert roles and pings are turned off. The spoiler list and redlist are then built, which can take several minutes, depending on how many tags in the filter are spoilered or hidden. Please wait until the lists are done being built before running more commands. This is a one-time process, unless manually initiated later.
